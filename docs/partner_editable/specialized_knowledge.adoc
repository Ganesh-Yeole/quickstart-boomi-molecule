This Quick Start assumes familiarity with basic concepts of networking, bastion hosts, volume sizing, and compute performance. It also assumes familiarity with the Dell Boomi variables that are required when deploying a Molecule cluster. These variables include Molecule Name, Local Path, Local Temp Path, Account Id, Account Name, and Account Password. If you don’t have have an Account Name or Password, you can enter an installation token provided by your system administrator into the ‘Boomi MFA install token’ field. If you are an administrator, see the ‘Create an Installation Token’ section in this guide. You will also need an API Token with this installation method. See the steps later in the document on how to create both of these. This Quick Start follows the patterns for Unattended Dell Boomi Molecule deployments found in the http://help.boomi.com/atomsphere/GUID-27BDD6B1-E6BD-48C9-8C6D-EC1B2CA60316.html[Dell Boomi User Guide^].

This deployment guide also requires a moderate level of familiarity with AWS services. If you’re new to AWS, visit the https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/[Getting Started Resource Center^] and the https://aws.amazon.com/training/[AWS Training and Certification website^] for materials and programs that can help you develop the skills to design, deploy, and operate your infrastructure and applications on the AWS Cloud.
